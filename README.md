# pet-sim

A small CLI pet simulator in Rust and a continuation of the pet simulator that
was originally in Visual C++ and was converted to C++ and later Java.

`pet-sim` was a project that I started as a part of a programming camp that I
attended a year or so ago to learn C++. Everyone who attended the class had to
create a final project, wether it be a game or a utility.

Me being a human being unoriginal, I had overheard someone talking about their
gerbil simulator, and since the only cool thing I could do so far is download
stuff off the internet, I decided that that was a great idea and here I am, five
years or so later, continuing this project.

Hopefully in the future I could get a GUI implementation of this. That would be
cool.

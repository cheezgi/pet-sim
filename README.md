pet-sim
=======

A small CLI pet simulator in Java and a continuation of the pet simulator that was originally in Visual C++ and converted to C++.

`pet-sim` was a project that I started as a part of a programming camp that I attended a year or so ago to learn C++. Everyone who attended the class had to create a final project, wether it be a game or a utility.

Me being a human being unoriginal, I had overheard someone talking about their gerbil simulator, and since the only cool thing I could do so far is download stuff off the internet, I decided that that was a great idea and here I am, a year or so later, continuing this project.

Hopefully in the future I could get a GUI implementation of this. That would be cool.

More coming later, once I document the source code.

**Currency**

You may notice that the currency used is ¤. This symbol, ¤, is the currency sign, used to denote an unspecified currency. I chose to use it because using gold points (GP) is overused.
